### Talk Title  
What Values Matter to AI Researchers?

### Abstract
As AI researchers, we seek the advancement of science or engineering progress. However, other values also drive us as individuals and as groups, including desires to "keep up" or move fast, to achieve recognition, to help others, to encourage diversity, to make money, and so on. Often, these unspoken values drive our priorities. Discussions of values are really discussions about ethics, but I quite frequently hear computer scientists say that we are unqualified to think about ethics, or should not have to think about ethics.  In this talk, I will share some of my values as a researcher over time and give two examples of past research projects of my own where unspoken values either positively or negatively impacted the quality of the research, as well as an example of how my values have changed in response to conversations with other AI researchers. I will raise some questions about what values may be driving the ways in which we currently "do AI" and talk about AI, and share my current thinking about how we can surface all of our values, so that we can have conscious conversations about the scientific choices we make.

### Bio 

Dr. Amanda Stent:

### Talk Title 
Ci eS para mí

### Abstract
For many years, I could not see myself as a programmer or computer scientist or any kind of scientist for that matter. I have always been a teacher at heart, but in my mid thirties, technology started to pique my curiosity, in particular AI for medicine. I will share with you my circuitous journey to becoming the first Latina to graduate from the College of Engineering and Information Technology with Ph.D. at the University of Maryland Baltimore County starting at the age of 38 and the first tenured Latina at the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras in the Department of Computer Science.

### Bio 
Dr. Patricia Ordóñez is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science faculty at the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras and thereby fulfilling two lifelong and one unexpected midlife dreams -- living in a Spanish speaking country, having the opportunity to make a greater difference in the world, and becoming a professor. Her research interests are in applying machine learning, data mining, and visualization to multivariate time series analysis, specifically to large repositories of clinical data (now known as Biomedical Data Science). She was the first Latina to graduate with a PhD from the College of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and the first female Associate Professor to earn tenure in the Computer Science Department at the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras (UPRRP). She is a former National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. She was co-Chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Council of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and she is serving as General Chair at the 2022 Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference. She is the recipient of the Great Minds in STEM 2021 HENAAC Award in Education. She is passionate about creating a more inclusive culture in computing and STEM and about bridging the digital and data divide in global healthcare and education.
