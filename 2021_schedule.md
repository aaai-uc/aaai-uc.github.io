### Talk Title 
Roles for Computing in Social Justice

### Abstract
Recent scholarship warns that computing work has treated problematic features of the status quo as fixed, failing to address and often even exacerbating deep patterns of injustice and inequality. This begs the question: what roles, if any, can computing play to support and advance fundamental social change? Through an analysis informed by critical scholarship, we articulate four such roles -- computing as a diagnostic, formalizer, rebuttal, and synecdoche. We discuss examples of research in algorithms, machine learning, and mechanism design that cut a path between solutionist and critical perspectives. We use these to highlight potential ways in which computational techniques can support, rather than supplant, other modes of understanding and tackling social inequities. Examining [Mechanism Design for Social Good](https://www.md4sg.com/) (MD4SG) -- a multi-disciplinary research network -- as a case study, we discuss how these insights may be used to support advocacy work aimed at fostering more equitable and just systems.

### Bio 
Rediet Abebe is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Junior Fellow at the [Harvard Society of Fellows](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/senior-junior-fellows-current-academic-year). Abebe holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University and graduate degrees in mathematics from Harvard University and the University of Cambridge. Her research is in artificial intelligence and algorithms, with a focus on equity and justice concerns. Abebe co-founded and co-organizes [Mechanism Design for Social Good](https://www.md4sg.com/) (MD4SG) -- a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary initiative. Her dissertation received the 2020 [ACM SIGKDD Dissertation Award](https://www.kdd.org/awards/sigkdd-dissertation-award) and an honorable mention for the [ACM SIGEcom Dissertation Award](http://www.sigecom.org/award-phd.html) for offering the foundations of this emerging research area. Abebe's work has informed policy and practice at the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Ethiopian Ministry of Education. She has been honored in the MIT Technology Reviews' [35 Innovators Under 35](https://www.technologyreview.com/innovators-under-35/2019) and the [Bloomberg 50](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-bloomberg-50/#Abebe) list as a one to watch. Abebe also co-founded [Black in AI](https://blackinai.github.io/#/), a non-profit organization tackling equity issues in AI. Her research is influenced by her upbringing in her hometown of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
