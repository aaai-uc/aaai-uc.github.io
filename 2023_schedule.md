### Bio 
Holly Yanco is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at UMass Lowell, joining the faculty in July 2001. She is also the director of the New England Robotics Validation and Experimentation (NERVE) Center.

She founded the Human-Robot Interaction Lab which consists of students at all stages of their careers, from freshmen to doctoral candidates. Dr. Yanco's research interests include human-robot interaction, better visualization of sensor data, adjustable autonomy, urban search and rescue, assistive technology, and robotics education. Her lab is funded by the National Science Foundation, the Army Research Office, Microsoft and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Dr. Yanco co-developed the Artbotics program, which combines art and computer science in a curriculum for high school and college students. She was the PI of the NSF-funded (DUE-0231363) development of Pyro, a Python-based robotics curriculum, which was selected as the Premier Courseware of 2005 by NEEDS. She has received teaching awards from UMass Lowell and MIT.

She is the General Chair of the 2012 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction. She has served on the Executive Council of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (2006-2009), as the Symposium Chair for AAAI (2002-2005) and as the Exhibition Co-Chair of the ACM/IEEE Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (2007-2009).

### Talk Title  
What is Human-Centered AI and Why Does It Matter?

### Abstract
While extraordinary advances in our ability to collect, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data have been transforming the fundamental nature of artificial intelligence (AI), the human aspects of  artificial intelligence, including how to support scientific creativity and human insight, how to address ethical concerns, and the consideration of societal impacts, have been less studied. Yet these human issues are becoming increasingly vital to the future of AI. I will reflect on a 30-year career in data science and AI in industry, government, and academia, discuss what it means for AI to be both rigorous and human-centered, and speculate upon future directions for data science and AI.

### Bio 

DR. CECILIA ARAGON is an award-winning author, airshow pilot, and the first Latina to earn the rank of Full Professor in the College of Engineering at the University of Washington in its 100-year history. She’s worked with Nobel Prize winners and has taught astronauts to fly. Her innovative research, and a stint at NASA designing software for Mars missions, led President Obama to call her “one of the top scientists and engineers in the country.” In addition to her love of math and science, she’s passionate about helping others face their own fears and challenges to achieve their goals.

Her award-winning memoir, [Flying Free (2020)](https://ceciliaaragonauthor.com/flying-free/), shares her journey of breaking past her own fears to become a champion aerobatic pilot. It debuted on five bestseller lists and is a TODAY Show and Hip Latina Recommended Read. Her 2019 book, [Writers in the Secret Garden](https://ceciliaaragonauthor.com/writers-in-the-secret-garden-2/), takes a close look at the fascinating world of fanfiction to explore how young people express themselves. Her latest book, [Human-Centered Data Science (2022)](https://ceciliaaragonauthor.com/human-centered-data-science/), is an accessible guide to best practices for addressing bias and inequality in data science and artificial intelligence.
